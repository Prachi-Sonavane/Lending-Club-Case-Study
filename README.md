## General Information

This project adrresses the data analysis for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. 
Risks involve : 
-  likely to repay the loan
-  not likely to repay the loan

So we have used Exploratory Data Analysis in this project to analyse the loan dataset of this company and use this analysis to carry out the business driven decisions to reduce or avoid loss and increase the profit of the company in lending loans to customers.


## Conclusions
1. Referring to our analysis done above on the given loan dataset, we have seen many factors that can help to target customers to pitch for offering them loans to get more customers with more profit and less risk component.
  
2. We can consider different  factors for this like which state’s customers most likely to take loans and pay back fully, income of customers and purpose of their loan and so on as mentioned above.

3. With this analysis, we can reduce the risk factor and increase profit for this loan lending company.
